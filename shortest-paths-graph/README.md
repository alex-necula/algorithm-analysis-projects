# Shortest Path - All Pairs

ID: Necula Alexandru, 322CD

## Contents

- **algo.h**

  - Generic shortest_path_all function.
  - Generic shortest_path function.

- **algo1.cpp**

  - Implements Dijkstra's algorithm using min-heap

- **algo2.cpp**

  - Implements Floyd-Warshall's algorithm (best solution for dense graphs)

- **algo3.cpp**

  - Implements Bellman-Ford's algorithm using queue (best solution for sparse
    graphs).

- **algo4.cpp**

  - Implements Johnson's algorithm based on Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford.

- **generator.cpp**

  - Source code for generating tests
  - Takes input from stdin, as follows

    - String which represents the graph type (`sparse` - density of 0.1, `dense`
      - density of 0.9, `random` - random density and number of vertices)
    - Integer which represents the number of vertices (for `sparse` or `dense`
      graphs)
    - Integer which represents the number of tests
    - Integer which represents the index of the first test

  - For a `random` graph, 10 < V < 1000

- **tester.cpp**

  - Tests the implemented algorithms while measuring efficiency
  - Takes input from stdin, as follows

    - `m` for manually generated tests in folder **'in'**, will check the
      reference in folder **'out'**
    - `g` for computer generated tests in folder **'other_tests"**, will only
      output average time for running tests
    - Two integers which represent the indexes of the first and the last test
    - e.g.: for input `0 10`, it will run `test0.in`, `test1.in` until
      `test10.in`
    - e.g.: for input `1 1`, it will run only `test1.in`

  - Prints average time for running a test in milliseconds

- **Makefile**

  - Contains rules:

    - **build_dijkstra**

      - compiles executable that tests Dijkstra's algorithm

    - **build_bellman**

      - compiles executable that tests Bellman-Ford's algorithm

    - **build_floyd**

      - compiles executable that tests Floyd-Warshall's algorithm

    - **build_johnson**

      - compiles executable that tests Johnson's algorithm

    - **generator**

      - compiles executable that generates tests

    - **run**

      - Runs tester

    - **clean**

- Folder **'in'** with input tests (10 manually generated tests)

  - Each test is called "**testID.in**", where ID represents the number of the
    test (e.g. test0.in)
    - `test1.in`: Default graph
    - `test2.in`, `test3.in`: Circular graphs
    - `test4.in`, `test5.in`: Complete graphs
    - `test6.in`, `test7.in`: Disconnected graphs
    - `test8.in`, `test9.in`, `test10.in`: Negative-weight graphs
  - Each test is structured as follows:
    - On the first line, V (int - number of vertices of the graph), E (int -
      number of edges)
    - E triplets: x, y, z - there is an edge from x to y, with weight z
  - V < 10^5, E <= min(N^2, 10^6)
  - 1 <= x, y <= V

- Folder **'out'** with output tests as reference for manual tests

  - Each test is called "**testID.out**", where ID represents the number of the
    test (e.g. test0.out)
  - Each test contains the matrix with the minimum distances between nodes
    (A[i][j] - minimum distance from vertice i to vertice j, `inf` if it is not
    reachable)

- Folder **'out_testing'** with generated output from the algorithm

  - Each test is called "**testID.out**", where ID represents the number of the
    test (e.g. test0.out)
  - This folder was made to verify what failed in a test

- Folder **'other_tests'** with subfolders **'in'** and **'out'**
  - Same structure as manual tests
  - Subfolder **'in'** contains tests generated by generator.cpp
    - 1 to 10: sparse with 50 vertices (change milliseconds to microseconds in
      `tester.cpp`)
    - 11 to 20: dense with 50 vertices
    - 21 to 25: sparse with 500 vertices
    - 26 to 30: dense with 500 vertices
    - 31: sparse with 1000 vertices
    - 32 : dense with 1000 vertices
    - 33 to 60: random number of vertices and edges
  - Subfolder **'out'** contains output of the algorithm
